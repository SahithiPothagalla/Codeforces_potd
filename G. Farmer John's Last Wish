G. Farmer John's Last Wish
time limit per test3 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Bessie has found an array a
 of length n
 on the floor. There appears to be a handwritten note lying next to the array, seemingly written by Farmer John. The note reads:

Help me, dear Bessie! Let f(a)
 denote the maximum integer k
 in the range [1,n)
 such that gcd(a1,a2,…,ak)>gcd(a1,a2,…,ak+1)
, or 0
 if no such k
 exists.

Bessie decides to help FJ. She defines g(a)
 to represent the maximum value of f(a)
 over all possible reorderings of a
.

Bessie decides to not only find g(a)
, but also the value of g(p)
 for all prefixes p
 of a
. Output n
 integers, the i
'th of which is g([a1,a2,…,ai])
.

Input
The first line contains an integer t
 (1≤t≤104
)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n
 (1≤n≤2⋅105
).

The following line contains n
 space-separated integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤n
).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output n
 integers on a new line: the i
'th of which should be g([a1,a2,…,ai])
.
